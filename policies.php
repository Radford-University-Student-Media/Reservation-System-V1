<br /><br />
<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Approved by the Student Media Committee September 2011</span>
<br /><br />
Only those who are active participants with Student Media may check out Student Media equipment. 
<br /><br />
The Assistant Director for Student Media, along with the Lab tech manager, determines checkout policies, subject to the approval of the Student Media Committee. 
<br /><br />
Those who wish to check out equipment must do so according to the procedure laid out by the Assistant Director. 
<br /><br />
Only those who are approved by their Student Media Leader, the Lab Tech manager, or the Assistant Director, will have access to the online reservation system. 
<br /><br />
The procedure for checking out equipment is as follows:
<br /><br />
The person wishing to check out a piece of equipment must submit a request through the online reservation system. 
<br /><br />
The request is submitted to the Assistant Director and the Lab tech manager, either of whom may approve or deny the request. 
<br /><br />
Note: reservations made within 24 hours of the anticipated pickup time cannot be guaranteed. Users are encouraged to plan ahead and make online reservations more than 24 hours before they plan to pick up the equipment. 
<br /><br />
Once a request has been approved, the user may come to the Student Media Lab to check out the equipment. The Assistant Director, the Lab Tech manager, or one of their designees will require the user to fill out a checkout form. This form serves to verify 1: what equipment is present and in working order at the time of checkout, and 2: to ensure that the person checking out the equipment will be responsible for it for the duration of the time they have it. 
<br /><br />
AT NO TIME is it acceptable for someone to check out a piece of equipment for someone else to use. 
<br /><br />
<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The person checking out the equipment is responsible for its safety from the moment of checkout to the moment it is returned.</span>
<br /><br />
In the event of breakage or failure, the Assistant Director, the Lab Tech Manager, and the Student Media Leader overseeing the user in question will come to a decision as to whether the breakage or failure was the fault of the user, or whether it was due to normal wear and tear. 
<br /><br /><br />
Additional equipment:
Some equipment will be checked out to individual Student Media Leaders for the duration of a semester. Members of the Leader.s organization may check out the equipment, subject to completing a checkout form. The user checking out equipment from their Student Media Leader will accept the same terms of responsibility as above. 
<br /><br />
